Hi, I’m Hannah. I’m a Postgraduate Researcher at the University of Nottingham. My research looks at how sense of agency develops across adolescence. I’m also interested in neurological development, mental health, tech and AI. Feel free to drop me a [message](https://hannahslack.wordpress.com/contact/) or arrange a [meeting](https://calendar.x.ai/hannahslack/shortmeeting)!
